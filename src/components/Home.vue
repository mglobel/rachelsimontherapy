      Finding a therapist, especially for queer or trans-affirming individuals, can be a daunting and complex task.  Iâ€™m glad you made it here. I am a psychotherapist and licensed social worker in Center City Philadelphia, and I work collaboratively with a wide range of clients who seek change, insight, and fulfillment. I work regularly with individual adults, children, and adolescents, as well as with families and couples.</p>
