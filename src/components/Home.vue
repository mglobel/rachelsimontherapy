    <p v-translate>Finding a therapist, especially for queer or trans-affirming individuals, can be a daunting and complex task.  I’m glad you made it here. I am a psychotherapist and licensed social worker in Center City Philadelphia, and I work collaboratively with a wide range of clients who seek change, insight, and fulfillment. I work regularly with individual adults, children, and adolescents, as well as with families and couples.</p>
    <p>
      Among the range of reasons that people begin therapy, there seems to be a common thread. People often want to improve some aspect of their emotional and mental health. In our work together, we will explore the areas of your life that are challenging or distressing, access and process difficult emotions, and make meaning of patterns in your unique narrative.
    <p>
      My practice is based in relational, psychodynamic and strengths-based theoretical orientations. I also integrate narrative and feminist approaches to enrich and empower the existing resilience in each client. This means that our work will not be limited to symptom reduction, but will also enhance overall insight and awareness to achieve more balance and fulfillment. 
    <p>
      I believe that by creating a safe and empathic space for a collaborative therapeutic relationship, I can help guide you in finding ways to navigate the ups and downs in your life. Each session provides an opportunity for strength, self-awareness, and self-compassion, and I strive to provide a supportive and holding environment for such growth to be possible. 
    <p>
      While my practice is specialized to provide non-pathologizing and affirming therapy for queer and trans individuals, I welcome clients of all gender identities and orientations.

      <b>Fees & Insurance:</b>
      <p>
        I offer clients a sliding scale individualizing fees based on a number of factors. You may contact me to discuss this fee structure before we begin.
      <p>
        As an out-of-network provider, I can work with you to obtain reimbursement from your insurance company.
